    <h2>Why Cook Steak?</h2>
    <p>Going to a steak house is great but it's also gonna cost you a pretty  penny. I say we can do this full steak meal completely homemade, on a  tight budget with results that are... dare I say better?</p>
    
    <p> <h3> Ingredients</h3> </p>

    <ul>
        <li>3 Tbsp high heat cooking oil (canola, vegetable, etc.)</li>
        <li>2 thick steaks</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (56g) butter</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 bunch Rosemary</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><h3> Instructions</h3></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Pat the steak dry with paper towels. Season generously with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
       <p></p>
        <li>Add high heat oil to a 10 inch skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until just about to smoke.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Season the steak generously with salt and pepper, add to the pan and sear for 2-3 minutes (or until a golden-brown crust is formed) on both sides.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Add 3 tablespoons of butter, crushed garlic cloves, and any hearty herbs. Based repeatedly with the butter until a medium-rare or 135 degrees Fareinheight is reached.</li>
       <p></p>
        <li> Once finished, pull the steak out, coat with a little butter, and let rest for 5-8 minutes.</li>
        <p></p>
